## Getting Started

To set up and run Brad's Store locally, follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have `npm` installed. You can check by running `npm --version` in your terminal. If `npm` is not installed, download and install Node.js.

### Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Brads-store.git
Navigate to the project directory:
sh
cd C:\Users\bradt\Desktop\coursework\Brads-store
Running the Project
Brad's Store is composed of two main parts: the backend and the frontend client. You need to run both parts simultaneously for the application to function correctly.

Start the Backend

1. In a terminal, navigate to the root directory of the project:
 cd C:\Users\bradt\Desktop\coursework\Brads-store
2. Run the following command to start the backend server:
npm start
3. Start the Frontend Client
 Open a new terminal window or tab.
4. Navigate to the client directory inside the project:
 cd client
5. Run the following command to start the frontend client:
npm start

After starting both the backend and the frontend client, your default web browser should automatically open to http://localhost:3000, where you can interact with Brad's Store.
